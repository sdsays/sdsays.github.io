<h1 class="title">Do you desire yourself?</h1>
<p>
Whatever a human achieves, is through concentration of mind and a developed intellect which can discriminate and will. It is very well known that a calm mind achieves more than an agitated mind. A personality living the agitations is tossed here and there with the compulsions of the acquired nature. Agitations are caused by attachments primarily, which subsequently leads to fear and anger.
</p>

<p>
How does attachment arise? It arises when we desire some object or person in some form or relation to make us happy or to enhance our experiences in life. It arises where there is a distinction between us and others. When there is no distinction, there is no desire.
</p>

<p>
Do you desire yourself? Obviously, no. You are just 'you'. There is no separation of space or time. Here and now, we are. So, where is the end of desires? Is it possible to live all the experiences of the world in a limited time? Every time a desire ends, new pops up, and if we notice carefully, the pattern is cyclic.
</p>

<p>
So, there are two ways, either we live all the expriences of the world or there remains no distinction between us and anything else in the world. Former is not possible, we know that. For latter, if we can somehow gain such a state where we are the underlying factor of everything, then everything will be us and what will be left to desire for! This is indeed…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;the state of enlightenment when we experience a fourth state of mind called super-conscious state apart from awake, dream and sleep states.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This state is wakeful sleep, where, like sleep, phenomenal world subsides but Self Awareness remains. Is it a myth or really a possibility for every human? Vedānta responds sympathetically that it is the reality and goal of human life. But, no science is a science if it can't be proven under similar conditions by anyone. So, we have records of many sages from time to time, who proved it, lived it and preached it. You and me too, can come to the same Knowledge of Oneness if we take discipline of Yoga sincerely.
</p>

<p>
End of desires is in the Knowledge that all this whatsoever, Is pervaded by a single entity which is mySelf too. This infinite expansion of 'I' is our correct identity. This realisation, not theoritcally but in living conviction, alone is Liberation. When there is just One, whom do we desire! Whom do we fear! Whom do we hate!
</p>

<p>
Just Love prevails.
